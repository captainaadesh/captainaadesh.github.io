Hi,

This is going to be my first blog post on my website. I titled it <b>"Hello, world!"</b> after thinking a lot. I finally came up with this title because I am a programmer and all the programmers out there are keeping their first blog post title <b>"Hello, World!"</b> too. So, I have to follow this rituals.

I am going to write a blog post twice a month because I like to try something new. In my opinion sharing knowledge and experiences is a good thing and deep down I always believe that when different skills and experiences collide, eye-opening ideas and solutions emerge. Personally this is the thing that keeps me motivated.

I will mostly write about my experiences with technology and life. I will also write some random stuffs about which I really have no idea at this moment. I love Programming, Technology, and Exploring new methods, ideas, or experiences.  

So, that's all. See you around!
